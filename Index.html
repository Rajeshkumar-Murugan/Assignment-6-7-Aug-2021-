    <h2>Assignment 6</h2>
    <h1><b>What is block ?</b> </h1>
    <p>A Block is also called as compound statement that is defined by curly braces {}
      Block is used to combine multiple statements into one statement where JavaScript expects only one statement.
   </p>
    
    <h1><b>What is scope ?</b></h1> 
    <p> Scope is a certain section/region of the program where a defined 
        variable can have its existence and can be recognized, 
        beyond that it can’t be accessed </p>

     <h1><b>What is block scoped</b></h1>
     <p>
        All the variables and functions that can be accessed inside a block are said to be inside that block scope, 
        hence called Block scoped.</p>


     <h1><b>What is Shadowing?</b></h1>
     <p>
        When a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its 
        outer scope and when we call the variable from the inner scope, 
        the value assigned to the variable in the inner scope is the value that 
        will be stored in the variable in the memory space. 
        This is known as Shadowing or Variable Shadowing.
     </p>


    <h1>What is illegal shadowing</h1>
     <p>
         While shadowing a variable, it should not cross the boundary of the scope, 
         i.e. we can shadow var variable by let variable but cannot do the opposite.
         So, if we try to shadow let variable by var variable, 
        it is known as Illegal Shadowing and it will give the error as “variable is already defined.” 
     </p>
     <h1> What is Hoisting</h1>
     <p> The behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the program leaving the values during compliation is called as Hoisting.
    </p>

     <h1>What is Deadzone</h1>
     <p>let/const variables cannot be read/written until they have been fully initialized, 
        which happens when they are declared (if no initial value is specified on declaration, 
        the variable is initialized with a value of undefined). 
        Accessing the variable before the initialization results in a ReferenceError. 
        The period for the variable from the start of the block until the initialization has completed is called as Deadzone
     </p>
    <b>Note:</b> This differs from var variables, which will return a value of undefined if they are accessed before they are declared.
    
    <p><u>Please check the console for example</u></p>
